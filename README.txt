The Social Chat Widget for Drupal 7 adds a chat icon to the bottom right of the screen. When you click it, social network icons appear that open the relevant application. 

Supported platforms are FaceBook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Skype, phone and email. 

You can upload your own custom icons

To use:
1) Enable module.
2) Configure the Social chat widget block. All icons are not set to display. So nothing will be displayed without selecting at least one icon. Configure to display on all pages you want the icons to appear.
3) That's it!
